# Product Review Exploration

The primary goal of this app is to show viewers how general attributes of a product like price, average rating, quantity sold and sales interact between each other and to investigate the underlying correlations between them. 

The secondary goal of this app is to let viewers decide what they want to see based on their preferences for some specific attributes of a product like high sales, or high average rating or both, and to allow views to subset the initial data based on their willingness, to obtain the detailed information and to study the relationships among those attributes with a particular subset of data. From the perspective of either primary goal or second goal of this product, this app emphasizes on each unique product and its characteristics, rather than each reviewer.
